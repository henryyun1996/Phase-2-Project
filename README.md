# React Phase-2 Project

## Virtual Art Gallery

Welcome to our virtual art show! We wanted to provide a space for artists big or small to come and show off their pieces on an easy to access platform! Because the focus is on appreciating different pieces of work - you will only be able to upvote on pieces and/or add them to your profile's favorites list!

## Intructions for access:

Simply log into the platform using your username and password! If you are a first time user - you can create an account by clicking the "Sign-In" button and creating your profile!

Once you have gained access - you are given your own accessible page where you can follow other local artists on the platform as well upload your own pieces!
