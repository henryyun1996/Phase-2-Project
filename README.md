# React Phase-2 Project

## Virtual Art Gallery

Welcome to our virtual art show! You can utilize this app to curate and personalize your art collection. There is a list of artworks that you can look through and even click on to see their description. You can even see what other people on the platform have curated themselves. Upvote on art pieces to show your support! Thank you for stopping by and creating your personal art gallery!
